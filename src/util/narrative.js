`Hello there! [2br] [w350] Have a seat, I've got a story for you! [w350] [wi]
[2br] Now, [w350] here’s a tale worthy enough for the bedtimes of all young software engineers around the world [w125] . [w120] . [w125] . [w125]
[2br] This is the story of Adam, [w350] and how he got the best job ever. [w500]`

let page1 =
`Say hi to Adam! [2br]
[w750] [f1] [w250] [f2] [w250] [f3] [w250]
Hah! [w350] I know what you’re thinking: [w350]
[2br] “Adam?! [w350] Why, that’s my name, too! [w350] This must be fate!" [w650]
[2br] Slow down, [w100] friendly reader! [w500]
[2br] The story has barely begun, [w350] [br] and there’s much more to discover!`

let page2 =
`One boring spring day, [w100]
Adam decided to take a gander at the available programming jobs on the web.
[2br] Just then [w500] . [100] . [100] .
[br] [ding] [br]
[2br] [f1] The most perfect job popped right up on the screen before his very eyes! [w220]
[2br] “Wow!” he exclaimed. [w400]
 “There’s never been a position I’ve been more hopeful to have in my whole life!” he said to his ever-supportive cats.`

let page3 =
`BEHOLD! [w350]
[2br] Adam is a front-end engineer who just so happens to specialize in [w80] . [w80] . [w80] . [w350]
[2br] [reactjs]
[2br] [w350] “Crazy, [w350] that’s exactly what I’m looking for in a developer!” [br] [w350]
[w350] You’re undoubtedly thinking to yourself.
[2br] BUT WAIT. [w250] There’s more!`

let page4 =
`Adam *also* does back-end engineering, most often using node.js! [w350]
He feels at home with the ones and zeroes. [w350]
[2br] Of course, [w100] the most important thing about Adam is that he loves to learn. [w200]
Self-teaching is no foreign territory to this one! [w100]
[2br] Constantly striving to expand his knowledge, [w100] Adam loves to take on side projects with coding friends on the weekends just to keep learning.
[2br] [w200] “What a guy!” [w350] You’re saying it out loud, [w50] now.`

let page5 =
`I, [w350] -AHEM- [w150] Adam
isn’t exactly an artist [w80] . [w80] . [w80] . [br]
But, [w100] he does have ample experience in UX and UI design and development!
[2br] Often working with only a small dev team or even solo,[w100]
Adam frequently finds himself iterating designs alone or with a partner,[w100] and has learned a lot about it as a result!
[2br] He always does his best to keep up with modern design principles, [w60] you know, [w60] to avoid looking like a time-traveling developer.`

let page6 =
`Adam has had the pleasure of developing with workers based around the globe,
[w100] so he’s no stranger to a remote-working environment. [w350]
[2br] And,[w100] perhaps the most exciting bit, [w100] Adam is located in. [w20] . [w20] . [w20]
[2br] EASTERN. [w450] STANDARD. [w450] TIME!!! [w450]
[2br] ". [w15] . [w15] . [w15] you mean [w15] . [w15] . [w15] . [w100]
I'D NEVER BE LONELY AGAIN?!?” [w200]
[2br] Yes, [w20] exactly!!`

let page7 = `So,[w100] Adam scrambled to apply to this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. [w350]

[2br] After all,[w50] how often does a developer run into a job listing like this? [w350]
Full remote,[w50] a team that seems fun and agreeable,[w50] good pay,[w50] and requirements that he ticks all the boxes for? [w200] Awesome! [w350]
[2br] He worked tirelessly to create his masterpiece. [w300] Through storms. [w300] Through hail. [w300] There was a blizzard.
[w300] Then a drought. [w300] Then a heatwave, [w50] and his office air conditioner was broken. [w350]

[2br] Until,[w80] finally, he was done! [w350] Ready to submit!`

let page8 = `Adam sat at his desk and became. [w50] . [w50] . worried. [w350]

[2br] “Did I go overboard?” [w250]
[br] “Did I miss a bug?” [w250]
[br] “Will they think it’s stupid?” [w250]
[br] “Did another applicant do the same?” [w250]
[br] “What if they never reply?” [w250]

But then. [w50] . [w50] . [w350]

[2br] [ding] [f1]

[2br] He got an email! [wi]

[br] He got the interview! [wi]

[br] He got the job! [f2]

[2br] Congratulations,[w50] Adam! [w350] Three cheers for Adam! [f3] [w350]

[2br] ~ The End ~`
